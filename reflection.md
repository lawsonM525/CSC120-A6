- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


- We (Michelle & Abby) worked together on this program. Inheritance seems to make programming easier and less abstract.
- We wrote the methods for the House class without much trouble, but ran into problems when trying to import java.util.Hashtable for the Library. 
- We got an  error that said "Hashtable could not be resolved to a type." We couldn't figure this out so we asked Abby's roommate Sophi and tried a few different things but couldn't get it to work.
- Inheritance makes coding less redundant and was very helpful to make the house, library and cafe classes without a bunch of extra work because we had the building class already there.
